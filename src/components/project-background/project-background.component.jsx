This included the shopping cart and the payment method as well as a sign-in page. Made to be used with mobile and desktop designs in order to accommodate a shopping experience on any device. Creating this project has helped me refine my workflow and solve real-world coding problems. The component based approach of React was the ideal structure for the layout of an e-commerce website.</p>
